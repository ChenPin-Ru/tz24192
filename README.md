## README for Programming in C - Postgraduate Term One Assessment

Project Overview

This repository contains the coursework for the first term of the postgraduate module Programming in C. 
The project is designed to enhance fundamental programming skills and develop an understanding of core C concepts through hands-on assignments and exercises.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

Build proficiency in C programming by solving real-world problems.
Apply theoretical concepts like control structures, data structures, and modular programming to practical tasks.
Gain experience with debugging, testing, and writing maintainable code.
